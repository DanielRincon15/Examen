          The Formula 1 teams are a select club of teams of drivers licensed to compete in the races that make up the F1 World Cup. Most of these teams are associated with major automobile brands, although more and more they are linked to large sponsors who invest fortunes to participate in "the great circus." Each team competes in the race with two drivers, and they have as many test drivers. From there, each team has a different organization chart, although they all have a multitude of engineers, who carry out a job almost as important as that of the drivers. In F1 a day we show you the most relevant teams, being able to consult their best historical results in Formula 1.
